I have over 40 years in the software industry. My current expertise is creating CI/CD Build-Test-Release pipelines for monolithic and microservices on cloud platforms; much of my recent work has been with Jenkins, git, and Python in Docker/Kubernetes.

I have extensive hands-on experience in every aspect of the software lifecycle: analysis, design, development, QA, CI/CD, DevOps, migration, and end-of-life. I work on platforms at every scale: microdevices, mobile, desktop, mainframe, and cloud. My experience crosses diverse industries such as Financial/Lending, SQL and NoSQL Databases, GPS Navigation, Biotechnology, Supply-chain Logistics, Energy, and Direct Marketing.
